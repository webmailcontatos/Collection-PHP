# Collection-PHP
 Excellent tool to make your experience with php array much cleaner and comfortable
 
 Small demonstration :
``` php
$collection = new Collection([1,2,3]);
$collection->sum() == 6
$collection->toJson() == {1,2,3}
$filter = $collection->filter(function($item)){
                            return $item > 1;
                         }
$filter->sum() = 5;

```
