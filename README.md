# Collection-PHP
 Excellent tool to make your experience with php array much cleaner and comfortable

## Installation

If you're using Composer to manage dependencies, you can include the following in your composer.json file:
```json
"require": {
    "faguima/collection": "1.0.0"
}
```

or

```sh
composer require faguima/collection
```

Then, after running composer update or php composer.phar update, you can load the class using Composer's autoloading:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

## A Simple Example

``` php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Collection\Collection as Collection;

$collection = Collection::make([1, 2, 3]);

echo $collection->sum(); // 6
echo $collection->first(); // 1
echo $collection->last(); // 3

$filter = $collection->filter(function ($item) {
    return $item > 1;
});
echo $filter->sum(); // 5;

```
